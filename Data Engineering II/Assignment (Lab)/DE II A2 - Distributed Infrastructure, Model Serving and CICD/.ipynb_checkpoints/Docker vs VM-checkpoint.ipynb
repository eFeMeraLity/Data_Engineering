    "## Do Not Use Docker if You Need to Boost Speed\n",
    "不要使用Docker，如果你需要提高速度\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers are smaller and require fewer resources than a virtual machine with a server and a database. At the same time, Docker will use as much system resources as the host’s kernel scheduler will allow. You should not expect Docker to speed up an application in any way.\\\n",
    "与带有服务器和数据库的虚拟机相比，Docker容器更小，需要的资源更少。同时，Docker将使用主机内核调度程序允许的尽可能多的系统资源。你不应该指望Docker以任何方式加速应用程序。\n",
    "\n",
    "What is more, Docker might even make it slower. If you are working with it, you should set limits on how much memory, CPU, or block IO the container can use. Otherwise, if the kernel detects that the host machine’s memory is running too low to perform important system functions, it could start killing important processes. If the wrong process is killed (including the Docker itself), the system will be unstable.\\\n",
    "更重要的是，Docker甚至可能让它变慢。如果您正在使用它，您应该设置容器可以使用多少内存、CPU或块IO的限制。否则，如果内核检测到主机的内存运行得太低，无法执行重要的系统功能，它可能会开始终止重要的进程。如果错误的进程被终止(包括Docker本身)，系统将不稳定。\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Docker’s memory adjustments – the out-of-memory priority on the Docker daemon – do not solve this issue. By contrast, an additional layer between an application and the operating system could also result in speed reduction. Yet, this decrease will be insignificant. Docker containers are not fully isolated and do not contain a complete operating system like any virtual machine.\\\n",
    "不幸的是，Docker的内存调整——Docker守护进程的内存不足优先级——并不能解决这个问题。相比之下，应用程序和操作系统之间的附加层也可能导致速度下降。然而，这种减少将是微不足道的。Docker容器不是完全隔离的，也不像任何虚拟机那样包含一个完整的操作系统。"

    "Docker最大的安全优势是它将应用程序分解成更小的部分。如果其中一部分的安全性受到损害，其他部分不会受到影响。\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while isolated processes in containers promise improved security, all containers share access to a single host operating system. You risk running Docker containers with incomplete isolation. Any malicious code can get access to your computer memory.\\\n",
    "然而，尽管容器中的隔离进程承诺提高安全性，但所有容器共享对单个主机操作系统的访问。运行不完全隔离的Docker容器是有风险的。任何恶意代码都可以访问您的计算机内存。\n",

    "There is a popular practice to run a lot of containers in a single environment. This is how you make your app predisposed to the Resource Abuse type of attacks unless you limit the resource container capabilities. For maximum efficiency and isolation, each container should address one specific area of concern.\\\n",
    "在单个环境中运行大量容器是一种流行的实践。这就是你如何使你的应用程序预先倾向于资源滥用类型的攻击，除非你限制资源容器的能力。为了获得最大的效率和隔离，每个容器都应该处理一个特定的关注领域。\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is Docker’s default configuration – users are not namespaced. Namespaces let software resources use other resources only if they belong to a specific namespace.\\\n",
    "另一个问题是Docker的默认配置——用户没有命名空间。命名空间允许软件资源使用属于特定命名空间的其他资源。\n",
    "\n",
    "Running applications with Docker implies running the Docker daemon with root privileges. Any processes that break out of Docker container will have the same privileges on the host as it did in the container. Running your processes inside the containers as a non-privileged user cannot guarantee security. It depends on the capabilities you add or remove. To mitigate the risks of Docker container breakout, you should not download ready-to-use containers from untrusted sources.\\\n",
    "使用Docker运行应用程序意味着使用根权限运行Docker守护进程。任何脱离Docker容器的进程都将在宿主上拥有与在容器中相同的特权。在容器内以非特权用户的身份运行进程不能保证安全性。这取决于您添加或删除的功能。为了降低Docker容器中断的风险，你不应该从不可信的来源下载现成的容器。"

If you’re in an industry with heavy regulatory requirements, for instance, you might not be able to swap containers for VMs, because VMs provide more isolation than containers.\\\n",

It’s clear that speed and efficiency are the biggest needs for DevOps teams, and Docker is better at providing these over VMs. While it still hasn’t completely replaced virtual machines in production environments, Docker’s potential is being noticed. That isn’t to say that VMs will soon be gone. Rather, Docker and VMs will co-exist next to each other, giving DevOps teams more choices in how to run their cloud-native applications.\\\n",
    "至少对VMs来说，未来的道路正在迅速改变，因为Docker在大公司中的受欢迎程度正在迅速上升。很明显，速度和效率是DevOps团队最大的需求，而Docker更擅长通过vm提供这些。虽然Docker在生产环境中还没有完全取代虚拟机，但它的潜力已经被注意到了。这并不是说虚拟机将很快消失。相反，Docker和vm将彼此共存，让DevOps团队在如何运行云原生应用方面有更多的选择。"
