We can use this to check whether the ref is the master branch or not.\\\n",
    "对于`post-receive` hook，您可能已经注意到在前面的表中，git传递了旧版本的提交哈希，新版本的提交哈希，以及作为标准输入推送到脚本的引用。我们可以用它来检查ref是否是主分支。\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to read the standard input. For each ref being pushed, the three pieces of info (`old rev`, `new rev`, `ref`) will be fed to the script, separated by white space, as standard input. We can read this with a `while` loop to surround the `git` command:\\\n",
    "首先，我们需要读取标准输入。对于每一个被推入的引用，三个信息（`old rev`，`new rev`，`ref`）将被输入到脚本中，用空白隔开，作为标准输入。我们可以用`while`循环来包围`git`命令：\n",

    "那么现在，我们将有三个变量集基于推入的内容。对于主分支推送，`ref`对象将包含类似`refs/heads/master`的内容。我们可以使用`if`构造来检查服务器接收的ref是否具有这种格式：\n",

    "对于服务器端hooks，git实际上可以将消息传递回client。任何发送到标准输出的内容都会被重定向到client。这让我们有机会明确地通知用户所做的决定。\n",
    "\n",
    "We should add some text describing what situation was detected, and what action was taken. We should add an `else` block to notify the user when a non-master branch was successfully received, even though the action won’t trigger a deploy:\\\n",
    "我们应该添加一些文本，描述检测到什么情况，以及采取了什么行动。当一个非主分支被成功接收时，我们应该添加一个`else`块来通知用户，即使这个动作不会触发部署：\n",
