There are hard limitations on a Kafka cluster when it comes to partitions, a limit of 4000 partitions per broker and a total of 200,000 across the entire cluster. Pulsar doesn’t suffer from this limitation, you can scale with millions of topics as the data is not stored within the brokers themselves but externally in Bookkeeper nodes.\\\n",
    "Pulsar是高度可扩展的。与Kafka相比，Pulsar的主要优势之一是你可以产生的主题的数量。Kafka集群在分区方面有严格的限制，每个broker的分区限制是4000，整个集群的分区限制是20万。Pulsar不受这种限制，您可以扩展数以百万计的主题，因为数据不是存储在broker本身中，而是存储在外部的Bookkeeper节点中。\n",

It allows old and less frequently used data can be put on slower and more cost effective storage. While tiered storage appeared in Kafka only recently and is only available in the Confluent Kafka Platform 6.0.0 onwards as a paid for option.\\\n",

    "It is hard to ensure reliability in streaming frameworks such as Pulsar or Kafka without ZooKeeper. For Kafka, although Zookeeper dependency is about to be removed from the clients, the brokers will continue to be heavily depend on Zookeeper for server failure detection, data partitioning and in-sync data replication. For Pulsar, each Pulsar instance relies on two separate ZooKeeper quorums. Local ZooKeeper operates at the cluster level and provides cluster-specific configuration management and coordination. Each Pulsar cluster needs to have a dedicated ZooKeeper cluster. Configuration Store operates at the instance level and provides configuration management for the entire system (and thus across clusters). An independent cluster of machines or the same machines that local ZooKeeper uses can provide the configuration store quorum.\\\n",
    "在没有ZooKeeper的情况下，很难在Pulsar或Kafka等流框架中保证可靠性。对于Kafka来说，尽管对Zookeeper的依赖将从客户端中移除，但是代理将继续严重依赖Zookeeper来进行服务器故障检测、数据分区和同步数据复制。对于Pulsar，每个Pulsar实例依赖于两个独立的ZooKeeper quorum。Local ZooKeeper运行在集群级别，提供集群特有的配置管理和协调。每个Pulsar集群需要有一个专用的ZooKeeper集群。配置存储在实例级运行，并为整个系统（从而跨集群）提供配置管理。一个独立集群的机器或者本地ZooKeeper使用的相同机器可以提供配置存储仲裁。"

The tenant is the most basic unit of categorization for topics (more fundamental than the namespace and topic name).\\\n",

    "For some use cases consumers don't need a complete \"image\" of the topic log. They may only need a few values to construct a more \"shallow\" image of the log, perhaps even just the most recent value. Log compaction would be highly beneficial in this case because it would keep consumers from needing to rewind through obscured messages. Without log compaction, it can also be very time intensive for Pulsar consumers to \"rewind\" through the entire log of messages.\\\n",
    "对于某些用例，消费者不需要主题日志的完整“映像”。他们可能只需要几个值来构建日志的更“浅层”映像，甚至可能只需要最近的值。日志压缩在这种情况下非常有益，因为它将使消费者不需要倒带模糊的消息。如果没有日志压缩，对于Pulsar消费者来说，“倒带”整个消息日志的时间也会非常密集。"
