    "Pulsar is built on the publish-subscribe pattern (often abbreviated to pub-sub). In this pattern, producers publish messages to topics. Consumers subscribe to those topics, process incoming messages, and send an acknowledgement when processing is complete.\\\n",
    "Pulsar是建立在发布-订阅模式（通常缩写为pub-sub）。在此模式中，生产者将消息发布到主题。消费者订阅这些主题，处理传入消息，并在处理完成时发送确认。\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subscription is created, Pulsar retains all messages, even if the consumer is disconnected. Retained messages are discarded only when a consumer acknowledges that those messages are processed successfully.\\\n",

    "__[Benefits of Pub/Sub Messaging](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/pub-sub-messaging/benefits/)__\\\n",
    "In modern cloud architecture, applications are decoupled into smaller, independent building blocks that are easier to develop, deploy and maintain. Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging provides instant event notifications for these distributed applications.\\\n",
    "在现代云架构中，应用程序被解耦成更小、更独立的构建块，更易于开发、部署和维护。发布/订阅(Pub/Sub)消息传递为这些分布式应用程序提供即时事件通知。\n",
    "\n",
    "The Publish Subscribe model enables event-driven architectures and asynchronous parallel processing, while improving performance, reliability and scalability.\\\n",
    "发布订阅模型支持事件驱动的体系结构和异步并行处理，同时提高性能、可靠性和可伸缩性。\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Eliminate Polling (消除轮询)__\\\n",
    "Pub/Sub messaging provides significant advantages to developers who build applications that rely on real-time events. Message topics allow instantaneous, push-based delivery, eliminating the need for message consumers to periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates. This promotes faster response time and reduces the delivery latency that can be particularly problematic in systems where delays cannot be tolerated.\\\n",
    "发布/订阅消息为那些构建依赖于实时事件的应用程序的开发者提供了显著的优势。消息主题允许即时的、基于推送的传递，消除了消息使用者定期检查或“轮询”新信息和更新的需要。这促进了更快的响应时间，并减少了交付延迟，在不能容忍延迟的系统中，交付延迟可能特别有问题。\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Dynamic Targeting (动态目标)__\\\n",
    "Pub/Sub makes discovery of services easier, more natural and less error prone. Instead of maintaining a roster of peers that an application can send messages to, a publisher will simply post messages to a topic. Then, any interested party will subscribe its endpoint to the topic, and start receiving these messages. Subscribers can change, upgrade, multiply or disappear and the system dynamically adjusts.\\\n",
    "发布/订阅使得发现服务更容易，更自然，更不容易出错。发布者将简单地向主题发布消息，而不是维护应用程序可以向其发送消息的对等体名册。然后，任何感兴趣的一方将订阅其端点到主题，并开始接收这些消息。用户可以更改、升级、增加或消失，系统会动态调整。"
